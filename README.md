I keep all my personal projects here. Much of it is pretty self-explanatory, but I do add some write-ups to explain the code and the thought processes behind certain descisions I make at each point. 
Some of the projects are still ongoing as I try to update them as I learn newer ways of improving the models, but I hope you learn something new all the same.


### Image Classification using an Artificial Neural Network: 
In this project, I try to tackle a very basic yet important task in Computer Vision, _**Image Classification**_, using a  very simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
